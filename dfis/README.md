Digital Forensic Scripts

Simply a collection of the more generally useful scripts I've created
for use during my forensic investigations.  They're mostly Perl and
generally I use them from a Linux investigative platform.  Many of the
scripts have dependencies on external tools like Sleuthkit.

Documentation is sadly lacking. But sometime in the future I might be more extensive with
it all and explain in-depth
