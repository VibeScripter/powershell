# Powershell Automation

Simple scripts etc etc will add continually. Supposed to also have Azure capabilities I guess lol :)

**FileEncrypt:** Encrypts files, might do a remote function for this

**AzureShutdown:** Starts at computer startup, checks auth keys for certain programs (see: O365 etc) and uhh... some other things. :)

**EC2-1:** allows the user utilizing EC2 buckets to auto-connect their device to the buckets upon device startup/wake

**DFIR Scripts:** Both help do a "mini deep dive" into certain system functions and collect information. One is written in Powershell, one in Visual Basic. There is also a whole folder of them written mainly in Perl just out of pure curiosity/learning for myself to understand Perl more
