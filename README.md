# Powershell Automation

Simple scripts etc etc will add continually. Supposed to also have Azure capabilities I guess lol :)

FileEncrypt: Encrypts files, might do a remote function for this

AzureShutdown: Starts at computer startup, checks auth keys for certain programs (see: O365 etc) and uhh... some other things. :)
